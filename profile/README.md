# Linked Data Ontologies

Welcome to **Linked Data Ontologies** on GitHub! This organization aims to provide a collaborative space for developers and researchers working on various vocabularies and ontologies in the Linked Data ecosystem. Our namespace is `w3id.org/ns`.

Our goal is to improve the developer experience (DevX) for people wanting to work on vocabularies and ontologies, making it easy for anyone to contribute to existing projects or create new ones.

## Participate and Contribute

Anyone can contribute to the existing vocabularies or create a new one, which will automatically appear in our list of projects. Here's how you can participate:

1. **Fork a repository**: Browse our [repositories](https://github.com/ontologies) and fork the one you want to contribute to.
2. **Create a new vocabulary**: If you have an idea for a new vocabulary, create a repository within the organization. This will automatically appear in the `w3id.org/ns` namespace for your vocabulary's URIs.
3. **Submit a pull request**: Make your changes or additions to the vocabulary and submit a pull request. The community will review and discuss your proposal.

## Examples of Linked Data Vocabularies

Here are some of the popular vocabularies in our organization:

- [Schema.org](https://schema.org): A widely used vocabulary for structured data on the internet.
- [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/): A vocabulary for describing people, relationships, and activities.
- [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#): A vocabulary for organizing knowledge using concepts, labels, and relationships.
- [RDF](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#): A simple vocabulary for describing digital resources.
